Why are you interested in taking CMSC320?
I’m interested in taking CMSC320 because based on my previous internship experience, I think it will be important to learn how to process, store, analyze, and interpret a lot of data. This course will help me build a foundation for these skills which I can use to apply to the real world. Also, the final project that we’re scheduled to do for this course sounds interesting and I’m excited to see what kind of datasets we will deal with.
